/**
 * Linked lists are more like 'chains' than 'lists'.
 * In a doubly linked list, each element has a pointer to the previous and next element.
 * They generally have a larger memory footprint because they hold extra pointers.
 * They are better than standard arrays for inserting and deleting data.
 * Visualizing them as a JSON-like structure looks like this:
 *
 *     {
 *       value: 1,
 *       next: {
 *         value: 2,
 *         next: {
 *           value: 3,
 *           next: {...}
 *         }
 *       }
 *     }
 *
 * Big O Notation for Linked List Operations:
 *
 * Search: O(N)
 * Access: O(N)
 * Insertion: O(1)
 * Deletion: O(1)
